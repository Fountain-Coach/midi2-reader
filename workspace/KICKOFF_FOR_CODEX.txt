Use AGENT.md in THIS directory (workspace/). Work only here.

Goal:
- Build the macOS PDFKit SwiftPM app and core library for a MIDI2 Reader.
- Two-track export (facsimile + readable) with ðŸ“Ž deep-link to facsimile.
- Preserve wording; stable anchors; ruled tables â†’ Markdown.

Operate:
1) Print a numbered plan; wait for my OK before edits/commands.
2) Implement incrementally, using ../tutorials/ as guidance (read-only).
3) Run: swift build -c release
4) If build fails, quote errors and apply minimal fixes (â‰¤3 attempts).
5) Add Export Siteâ€¦; write outputs under ./Artifacts/
6) Use ../scripts/* for PRs (after commit).

Guardrails:
- Do NOT touch ../reference/ or ../tutorials/
- Allowed: swift build/run, git add/commit/push (inside workspace only)
- Ask before running commands.
