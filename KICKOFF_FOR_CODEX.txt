Use AGENT.md at the repo root.

Goal:
- Build the macOS PDFKit SwiftPM app `MIDI2SpecReader` and its core library.
- Implement the two-track export: FACSIMILE (page renders + overlays) and READABLE (anchors + ToC + tables) with deep-links to the facsimile.
- Preserve normative wording; parser-only (no OCR).

Operate like this:
1) Print a numbered plan with files to edit/create; wait for my OK.
2) Make changes.
3) Run: swift build -c release
   - If the build fails, quote each error and apply minimal fixes; re-run until green.
4) Run the app and wire up Export Siteâ€¦ to produce Artifacts/ for opened PDFs.
5) Create/Update Artifacts/QA.md and provenance.json.
6) Stage and open/update a PR using scripts/commit_pr.sh (or scripts/smart_pr.sh).

Guardrails:
- Work ONLY inside this repo. Ask before running commands.
- Allowed: swift build/run, git add/commit/push, gh pr create.
- Never: sudo, brew install, curl|sh, rm -rf outside repo.
