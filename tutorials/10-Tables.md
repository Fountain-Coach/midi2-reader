# 10 â€” Tables (ruled grids â†’ Markdown)

## What to say to Codex
```
Implement ruled-table detection:
- Use CGPDFScanner to collect path ops (m,l,re,S/s).
- Keep long straight horizontal/vertical segments; cluster to row/col guides (~2pt tol).
- For each cell rect, use PDFPage.selection(for:) to get text.
- Emit Markdown tables via tableToMarkdown.
- Attach a [ðŸ“Ž table source] link to the nearest cell region in facsimile.
