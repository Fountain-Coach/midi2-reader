# 06 â€” Minimal SwiftUI App (opens PDFs)

## What to say to Codex
```
Create a SwiftUI app target 'MIDI2SpecReader' that can:
- Open multiple PDFs via NSOpenPanel
- Parse each PDF using a placeholder parser (to be filled)
- List headings in a sidebar (for now, just mock with file names)

Add basic README build/run instructions.
Commit: "feat(app): SwiftUI shell with open PDFs and sidebar"
```
## Expected results
- App runs, opens PDFs, lists them in sidebar.

## Verify
```bash
swift run MIDI2SpecReader
```
