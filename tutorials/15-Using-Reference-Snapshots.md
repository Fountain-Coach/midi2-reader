# 15 â€” Using Reference Snapshots

Jump forward to the working example:
```bash
../scripts/use-lesson.sh final
swift build -c release && swift run MIDI2SpecReader
```
Reset to clean starter:
```bash
../scripts/reset-workspace.sh
```
These scripts only copy into `workspace/`; your Git history remains clean.
