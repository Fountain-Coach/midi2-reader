# 09 â€” Tables (ruled grids â†’ Markdown)

Tell Codex:
```
Implement ruled-table extraction:
- CGPDFScanner: collect m/l/re and stroke ops
- Identify long H/V lines â†’ cluster row/col guides (~2pt tolerance)
- For each cell rect, use PDFPage.selection(for:) â†’ text
- tableToMarkdown for emission
- Add [ðŸ“Ž table source] to nearest cell region

Plan â†’ build â†’ run â†’ export.
Commit: "feat(tables): ruled grid extraction â†’ Markdown".
```
**Verify**: At least one grid page becomes a Markdown table.
