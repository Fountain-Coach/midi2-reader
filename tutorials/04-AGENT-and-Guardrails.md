# 04 — Add `AGENT.md` + Guardrails

## What to say to Codex
```
Add AGENT.md at repo root with:

- Goal: MIDI2 Spec Reader producing facsimile + readable tracks; no OCR.
- macOS-only; use PDFKit.
- Preserve normative wording; stable anchors; tables → Markdown.
- Default pipeline (build → run → export → PR); strict mode flag planned.
- Guardrails: work only inside this repo; ask before commands.

Then stage and commit: "docs: add AGENT.md and guardrails"
```
## Expected results
- `AGENT.md` with clear plan, committed.

## Verify
Open AGENT.md; it should contain our two-track plan at a high level.
