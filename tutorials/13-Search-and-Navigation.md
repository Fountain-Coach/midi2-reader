# 13 — App Search + Jump-to

## What to say to Codex
```
Add a search field (Cmd-F):
- Index headings + paragraphs by node.id → (docID,page,bbox,excerpt).
- Selecting a result scrolls PDFView to the first span bbox and highlights it briefly.

Commit: "feat(app): search + jump-to selection"
```
## Expected results
- You can type a term and jump to locations quickly.
