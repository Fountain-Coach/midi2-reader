# 05 — Minimal App Shell

Tell Codex:
```
Add SwiftUI app structure:
- File → Open PDFs… (NSOpenPanel) [wire later]
- Sidebar placeholder listing (mock)
- README (workspace-specific)

Plan, implement, build & run.
Commit: "feat(app): SwiftUI shell".
```
**Verify**: The app launches from `swift run MIDI2SpecReader`.
